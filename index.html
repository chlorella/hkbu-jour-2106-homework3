            <p>
              It is well known that gender pay gap is exist. According to the 2016's Global Gender Gap Report done by World Economic Forum,
              there is no country on earth where women make as much as men for the same work. In the same time, the report
              state that it would take
              <mark>another 170 years</mark> to close the global pay gap between men and women.
            </p>
            <p>But someone still doubt in weather gender pay gap is exist, or it is only cause by women choose to be pay less.
              <a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/how-common-sense-shows-gender-pay-gap-is-a-myth/news-story/6f7f2be3ec8c56484f83b798ff6d548f">[ref]</a>
            </p>
            <p>As the result, Diversity Council Australia, released an important report together with KPMG and the Workplace
              Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). Called She’s Price(d)less – the economics of the gender pay gap, to dispaly
              the real picture underlying the gender pay gap.</p>

          <p>The resulting report counters the myths and provides the evidence that refutes a whole range of other “reasons”
            put forward about women earning less because they “choose” to work part-time or take time out of the workforce

          <h2>Women are paid less because they ‘choose’ to work part-time</h2>
          <p>Our report showed that there has been a significant decrease in the impact of part-time employment on the gender
            pay gap. It has actually declined from 14% to 4%, in part because of an increase in higher-paid part-time roles
            for women. This is good news as it means that much of the hard work that has been done on improving flexible
            work options is starting to pay off.
            <br><br> The idea of “choice” becomes questionable, however, when one considers that overwhelmingly it is still
            women who take on the bulk of unpaid caring roles within families. There are a number of reasons for this (historical
            and social norms playing a significant part) but, given that men are paid more than women, for many families
            it just does not make financial sense for men to work part-time as it will result in a bigger cut to the family
            budget.
          </p>
        </dir>
        <dir class="col-lg-6">
          <h2>Women are paid less because they ‘choose’ lower-paying jobs</h2>
          <p>Our report showed that industrial and occupational segregation continue to be significant contributing factors
            to the gender pay gap. But while occupational segregation is decreasing (i.e. the different types of roles men
            and women do), the impact of industrial segregation (i.e. the different industries that men and women work in
            like mining or healthcare) has increased.

            <br><br>Women are not “choosing” to work in lower paying industries but, when large numbers of women start to
            work in an industry, they all get paid less. As Rhaina Cohen explained in an article in the Atlantic:

            <br><br>A study [by the sociologists Asaf Levanon, Paula England, and Paul Allison], which examined census data
            from 1950 to 2000, found that, when women enter an occupation in large numbers, that job begins to pay less,
            even after controlling for a range of factors like skill, race and geography. Their analysis found evidence of
            “devaluation” – that a higher proportion of women in an occupation leads to lower pay because of the discounting
            of work performed by women.

            <br><br>So, in other words: 50 years of data proved that the more women join an industry the less everyone gets
            paid.

            <br><br>If that’s not convincing enough, Cohen also pointed to a study showing that higher the percentage of
            women in an industry the lower its perceived “prestige”; and a study from 2007 that found that even where men’s
            low-wage jobs demand far less in terms of skill, education and certifications than women’s low-wage jobs, the
            male-dominated ones usually command higher hourly pay.</p>

          <h2>Women don’t have the same levels of education as men</h2>
          <p>Despite women reaching higher levels of educational attainment, there has not been an associated decrease in the
            pay gap between women and men. This graph from the KPMG report makes it clear:</p>
        </dir>
        <dir class="col-lg-4">

          <h2>The pay gap figure is bogus because it does not reflect ‘like-for-like’ pay gaps for employees in the same or comparable
            roles
          </h2>
          <p>It must be said that while it is illegal to pay women less than men doing the same jobs, it is still happening.
            WGEA’s annual report shows that, even in their first year in the workforce, male graduates earn more than female
            graduates entering the same roles. Recent estimates from Australia suggest that for partners in top firms, the
            like-for-like gap is up to 5%.</p>
        </dir>
        <dir class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>Women don’t negotiate for better pay so it’s their fault if they’re paid less</h2>
          <p>Again, it’s not true to say women don’t ask for raises. They just don’t receive them at the same rate as men. And
            there is evidence that when women do negotiate, they are actually penalised.
            <br><br> A recent study from Cass Business School, the University of Warwick and the University of Wisconsin
            shows that women ask for wage rises just as often as men but men are 25% more likely to get a raise when they
            ask. The study collected data from 4,600 Australian workers across more than 800 employers and found no difference
            in the likelihood of asking between the two genders. The authors suggested that it might actually be “how” women
            ask, that a lack of assertiveness in negotiations is often cited as a potential reason why women might make less
            money than men for similar work.
            <br><br> As WGEA explains, negotiation is usually associated with agentic, and therefore masculine, behaviour.
            When employers negotiate with women, they tend to offer less and are more likely to resist influence attempts.
            Studies have shown that women’s reluctance to enter negotiations is partly because they are penalised more than
            men for doing so. The more women anticipate backlash, the less inclined they are to initiate negotiations.
            <br><br> In other words, women are asking for raises but, if they ask too assertively, they’re turned down for
            being too pushy, and if they don’t ask assertively enough, they aren’t good negotiators so they don’t get a raise.</p>
        </dir>
        <dir class="col-lg-4">
          <h2>The pay gap reflects choices women make, not discrimination</h2>
          <p>First of all, there’s that questionable word, “choice”, again.
            <br><br> Secondly, what our study showed was that sex discrimination continues to be the single largest factor
            contributing to the gender pay gap, increasing from 35% in 2007 to 38% in 2014.
            <br><br> Sex discrimination in the report accounts for everything that is left after all the other factors that
            have an impact on the gender pay gap, such as age, tenure, time out of the workforce, occupation, industry, part-time
            work and sector, have been taken into account. This means that more than a third of the gender pay gap is the
            result of gender discrimination and unconscious bias.
            <br><br> In other words, women are paid less than men simply because they are women.
            <br><br> So if the new report She’s Price(d)less reveals anything above and beyond what we already know about
            pay inequity in the Australian economy, it is that we now know exactly what constitutes the gap.
            <br><br> Not only should this be enough to silence the sceptics but it should shine a light for individuals and
            their organisations – and indeed the wider community – on where to start fixing the problem.</p>
